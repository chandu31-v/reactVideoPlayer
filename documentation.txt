Implementation details

The main App file uses the “VideoContext” property and sets the VideoPage and PlayList component.The entire project is divided into 3 different folder structure. They are playList, search and video.  

Playlist:

The list of the videos in the playlist is taken from the pre-defined playlist.json file. The playlist folder has “listComp” which is used to set the preview image and the name of the video. It contains a function handleLCick to handle the click of the playlist videos.
 The “playList” has the code for showing the searched the videos in the playlist or the entire list if it’s not searched. The “videoPlayList” has the code for the list of the playlist videos and has the implementation for draggable property to allow the dragging of the video list. It has a handleDragDrop function to handle the swapping of the playlist videos.

Search:
The “search” file has the code for the functionality to set the values set from the “seachPlaylist” file.
The “searchPlaylist” has the functionality to return the playlist based on the search value.

Video: 
The “videoPlayer” is component that actually uses the ReactPlayer library to play the video, this is a resuable component that can be used in any other componenets. It has a videoAutoPlay function to trigger when the video ends.
The “videoPage”  resuses the “videoPlayer” and set the different styling to the UI.

We use the following inbuilt react components such as:
•	ReactPlayer

•	{useEffect, useContext, useState}
